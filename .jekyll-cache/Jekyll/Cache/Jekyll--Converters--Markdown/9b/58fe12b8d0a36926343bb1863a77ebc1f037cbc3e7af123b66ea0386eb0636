<p>Why Change To Windows Vista:  Part 3 of 4</p>

<p>We are almost there, this is part 3 of 4.  Actually it has somewhat more meat than Part 2, but once again starts trailing off towards the last few reasons covered by the Tennessee Mountain Man today.  Computer man canâ€™t help but wonder if a third grader actually did prepare Microsoftâ€™s reasons to smile or upgrade to Vista.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>MS#51. â€œBecause you live to playâ€</p>

<p>The Tennessee Mountain Man actually wishes Microsoft had this one right for the average American.  But, alas Americans play less than the citizenry of most other countries.  Outsourced computer repair techs, unlike the money moguls at Microsoft, recognizes it now takes two people working not only full time but over time to feed and clothe the family.</p>

<p>â€œBecause we love to playâ€, may have been more accurate; but living to play?  Americans have long proven their propensity to live for work unfortunately.</p>

<p>Remote helpdesk 1 is the proof in the pudding!  Who has time for computer games?  As to whether Windows Vista makes the games easier, faster, more funâ€¦.give me a break.</p>

<p>MS#52. â€œ Take control of game timeâ€</p>

<p>Kudos !!</p>

<p>MS#53. â€œBecause you can get more done when you work togetherâ€</p>

<p>Microsoftâ€™s brain storming appears to have produced great and long followed general rules for success in any endeavor.<br />
â€œThe house divided against itself cannot standâ€.  Mutual cooperation on the job, in sports, or in family affairs goes a long way.</p>

<p>As to inviting people to work with you on projects over the Internet, a company network, or an ad-hoc wireless networkâ€¦.We had been doing that for yearsâ€¦ long before Windows XP was corrupted to come up with Windows Vista simply to enrich Microsoft coffers.</p>

<p>MS#54. â€œStay entertained wherever you goâ€</p>

<p>Some of these remind old online computer repair geezers of some of the motel ads on TV.  Come On!!!!!!!!!!  Wow!  Online helpdesk would have never thought of that little trick before Vista and without the help of Bill Gates!  N E X T !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>MS#55. â€œBecause success tomorrow starts todayâ€</p>

<p>Amen!!!!! Today is the first day of the rest of your life, but P L E A S E  get a life.  Hopefully not after Microsoftâ€™s blueprint.</p>

<p>The rest of this reason, like most of their reasoning, appears to be little more than someone â€œmaking workâ€ or needing to fill newspaper space.  Speaking of needing to get a life!</p>

<p>MS#56. â€œPrint what you seeâ€</p>

<p>Hogwash!!!!  Unlike the rest of mankind, apparently Microsoft never heard of Windows 3 or the â€œprint screenâ€ command.</p>

<p>MS#57. â€œBecause you donâ€™t need a PC to watch your home moviesâ€</p>

<p>Really?  Can you say Kodak?  How about Polaroid?  Well, donâ€™t!  Outsourced it services still needs the online pc repair work.</p>

<p>MS#58. â€œFill your home with musicâ€</p>

<p>Yes, please!  Music soothes the savage beast!  Maybe Microsoft needs something besides elevator music, however.
We used to do that with a radio which had a red light that burned when the radio was on.  As a lad the Tennessee Mountain Man used to set for hours with an eye glued to that light watching radio shows.  Those were the days!!!</p>

<p>Dacomputerman knows all about that! That was all before WMP 11 and Microsoftâ€™s control over his entertainment choices.</p>

<p>MS#59. â€œMake a masterpieceâ€</p>

<p>â€œBlend your photos and home videos into a rich movie experience, complete with soundtrack, titles and credits, and creative transitions.â€</p>

<p>So Microsoft can report you!  You do know, they know what you had for dinner last evening and whether you skipped breakfast this morning, donâ€™t you?  Listenâ€¦.sounds like they are the phone with an artist formerly known as Prince now.</p>

<p>MS#60. â€œBecause you want your video memories to stay true to lifeâ€</p>

<p>â€œWindows Movie Maker lets you retain high-definition quality as you capture, edit, and publish movies from your HD camcorder.â€</p>

<p>The remote computer repair folks told me this is â€œdÃ©jÃ  vu all over againâ€.  Dacomputerman thought he was just getting old and senile.</p>

<p>Oh, and donâ€™t forget this little ditty:  â€œSome product features are only available in certain editions of Windows Vista and may require advanced or additional hardwareâ€.</p>

<p>MS#61. â€œStand strong against hackersâ€</p>

<p>â€œThe easy-to-use Windows Firewall with Advanced Security provides advanced protection to help shield you and your PC from malicious attacks.â€</p>

<p>Come onâ€¦come on!  Stop laughing and get back to work.</p>

<p>MS#62. â€œBecause it remembers what you like to do and helps you do it fasterâ€</p>

<p>Please refer to MS#59 above!  Then go immediately to the Prefetch File located in C:\Windows and dump itâ€™s contents.  Do this daily and note the improvement in OS response time.</p>

<p>MS#63. â€œHelp is always availableâ€</p>

<p>By now most people have learned to avoid the helpdesk of major computer companies including Microsoftâ€¦maybe especially Microsoft and certainly especially if your first language is English.</p>

<p>Fortunately also most people ignore the recommendation in this reasoning.  Otherwise a lot of us would be out of business.</p>

<p>MS#64. â€œKeep your files confidentialâ€</p>

<p>Can you say, dÃ©jÃ  vu once again?  Swamp land, anyone?  anyone?  how about a bridge?</p>

<p>MS#65 â€œSend a fax on the spotâ€</p>

<p>â€œWindows Fax and Scan makes sending and receiving faxes directly from your PC as simple as using e-mail. With fax templates linked to your address book, itâ€™s easy to retrieve a fax number, attach your documents, and just click to send.â€</p>

<p>Kudos!!!!!!  someone caught sleeping?!</p>

<p>MS#66. â€œBecause everyone goofs sometimesâ€</p>

<p>Never heard of restore points before Vista ,huh?</p>

<p>MS#67. â€œBecause e-mail is your lifelineâ€</p>

<p>â€œHe who lives by the sword, dies by the swordâ€.</p>

<p>MS#68. â€œStay on top of your familyâ€™s scheduleâ€</p>

<p>The old magnet on the refrigerator didnâ€™t work, I doubt this will.  But maybe it will work better for you than for the old da computer man,</p>

<p>MS#69. â€œBecause you want the quality of your printouts to match the quality of your workâ€</p>

<p>O.K.  Kudos!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>MS#70. â€œYour PC is ready when you areâ€</p>

<p>So is your significant other!!  Right.  Just keep the aspirin handyâ€¦headaches do happen! And, donâ€™t miss the standard little caveat at the end of the reasoning.</p>

<p>MS#71. â€œKeep your favorite things at your fingertipsâ€</p>

<p>Favorite things have nothing to do with computers or Windows Vista.
Please excuse the computer man while he day dreams a bit.  Favorite thingsâ€¦O.K. unmentionable.  So move on to Meerschaum pipe, BCA smoking tobacco, Scotch, T Bone, Lobsterâ€¦.alrightâ€¦alrightâ€¦moving along.</p>

<p>MS#72. â€œGet the latest news delivered right to your desktopâ€</p>

<p>schhhhhhh!  Please donâ€™t tell Microsoft that these news tickers have been around forever.</p>

<p>MS#73. â€œBecause your photos and home movies donâ€™t have to be stuck in your PC anymoreâ€</p>

<p>ho!  hum!!</p>

<p>MS#74. â€œBecause your memories need a little mood musicâ€</p>

<p>How many times and ways can we say, dÃ©jÃ  vu?</p>

<p>MS#75. â€œBecause you want professional-looking photos from your own printerâ€</p>

<p>And, How many times can you take, dÃ©jÃ  vu?  If only Microsoft had considered that question!!
